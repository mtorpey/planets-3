It's too hot, I will not be sending a mission there for now.
However, there was a successful mission to Mercury before.
We can base the new one on that experience.

TODO: find reference and the year of the Mercury mission.

Mercury is a major Roman god, being one of the Dii Consentes within the ancient
Roman pantheon. He is the patron god of financial gain, commerce, eloquence (and
thus poetry), messages/communication (including divination), travelers,
boundaries, luck, trickery and thieves; he is also the guide of souls to the
underworld. He was considered the son of Maia and Jupiter in Roman mythology.
