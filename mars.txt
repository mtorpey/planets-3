Cold and dry, but everything is my favourite colour.
Two moons could be a problem for Wolfman.
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity.

In ancient Roman religion and myth, Mars was the god of war and also an
agricultural guardian, a combination characteristic of early Rome.  He was
second in importance only to Jupiter and he was the most prominent of the
military gods in the religion of the Roman army.  Most of his festivals were
held in March, the month named for him (Latin Martius), and in October, which
began the season for military campaigning and ended the season for farming.

It really is very cold on Mars.
